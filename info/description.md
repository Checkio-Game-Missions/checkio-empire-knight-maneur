Chess is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks and denoted with numbers 1 to 8) and eight columns
(called files and denoted with letters a to h) of squares.

The knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal,
thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally
and one square vertically.

You are given the start and end squares as chess coordinates separated by a hyphen.
You should find the length of the shortest path for the knight from one point to another on the chessboard.
